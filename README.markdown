# Installation
To begin using, check out the project like so:

    git clone http://github.com/pbyrne/dotfiles.git ~/workspace/dotfiles

This package assumes that you have Ruby and Make installed for automation.

# Usage

The first time you use this, use `make install` to back up your current dotfiles. Then, going forward, use `make update` to update the latest changes. A good ol' `git pull` would do the trick, too, for most changes.
